                Talkfit is the virtual companion to Walkfit; a monthly online gathering designed 
                to keep the spirit of connection alive when meeting in person isn&apos;t possible. While 
                Walkfit brings people together through physical and social activity in outdoor settings, 
                Talkfit offers a physically distanced way to stay engaged, build friendships, and share 
                experiences from the comfort of home.

                Born out of the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, Talkfit was launched to support Walkfit
                participants, both visually impaired individuals and volunteers, who were suddenly cut off from
                regular in-person interactions. As Walkfit adapted to changing circumstances, not everyone was 
                able to join those transitions. Talkfit was created as a response to that reality, offering a way 
                to maintain connection, combat social isolation, and ensure no one felt left behind.

                Talkfit takes place the old-fashioned way - over the phone. With no visual components, these audio-only
                conversations create a level playing field where all participants can engage equally.

                Talkfit calls are held on the third Monday of every month from 7:00 PM to 8:30 PM EST. Just pick up the
                phone and join the conversation.
